You can check out my [About](/about/) page for more info on me, but long story short: I'm a creative software dev (https://nevercenter.com) and occasional game designer who has long been annoyed by the complicated pipeline required for game dev. 

What I'm building is the ideal dev platform for me: 
- entirely code-based (C#), no gui 
- fully generative at runtime via procgen and ai, with almost zero external assets required 
- single codebase deployable across steam/consoles, mobile, AR/VR, and eventually web
- built atop Godot (essentially using it as a library)
- suitable for games, but also apps
- shippable-quality polish from the beginning of a project, especially in terms of ui

I want to be able to start up a new idea, be up and running as quickly as possible, re-use previous work like crazy, and have my prototype be theoretically shippable from the start. I also want to maintain complete creative freedom, so I'm avoiding diffusion-based AI for now.

You can read more detail about the engine [here](/engine/).
