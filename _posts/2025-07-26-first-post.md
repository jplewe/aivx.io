(Note: this post is a live draft, and will likely be edited.)

You can check out my [About](/about/) page for more info on me, but long story short: I'm a [creative software dev](https://nevercenter.com) and [occasional game designer](https://www.metacritic.com/game/shibuya/) who's long been put off by the slow, complex, and painful method of game dev in popular game engines. I've built up a backlog of 100+ game designs I'd like to create, and before the advancements of the past few years I assumed it would be impossible to get anywhere near that number.

Now I'm building my [ideal platform for rapid game/app dev](/engine/) to get me to 100: 
- entirely code-based (C#), no gui. all you need is 1 coder (human or ai) to make a game
- everything is generated at runtime via procgen and ai, no complex asset pipeline or external apps
- full creative control: the ai aspect is llm-guiding procgen, rather than diffusion-based generation
- single codebase deployable across steam/consoles, mobile, AR/VR, and eventually web
- built atop Godot (essentially using it as a library) for constant free updates
- designed for building apps as well as games
- designed to be easy to interact with by coding AIs (because everything is done in code)
- shippable-quality polish from the beginning of a project, especially in terms of ui

The engine itself won't be released anytime soon, but the first simple game is getting close to a shippable state. I've been building a wide range of projects simultaneously as I build out the core features of the engine, to help ensure I only add what I actually need. I'll finish up this post with a quick first peek at two of them:

[AIVX PUSH](/push/) is the first game I'm releasing with the engine, hopefully in a few months. It's an arcade puzzle game inspired by Lumines and Tetris Effect, with trippy ever-changing procedural visuals and a new mechanic, which I first prototyped many years ago in Unity.

[AIVX CITY](/city/) is one of my experimentations with creating a metaverse. It's an infinite cyberpunk city generator, full of AI-controlled characters you can chat with, play games with, and who can play roles in generated quests. Since all my games are generated at runtime with no additional cost to install size, performance, etc., it's an ideal platform for a metaverse, and any of my other games can be launched within the City.
