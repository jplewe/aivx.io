You can check out my [About](/about/) page for more info on me, but long story short: I'm a [creative software dev](https://nevercenter.com) and [occasional game designer](https://www.metacritic.com/game/shibuya/) who has long been annoyed by the complicated pipeline required for game dev. I have a backlog of 100+ game designs I'd like to create, and before the last few years I assumed it would be impossible to get anywhere near that number.

What I'm building is the ideal dev platform for me: 
- entirely code-based (C#), no gui 
- fully generative at runtime via procgen and ai, with almost zero external assets required 
- single codebase deployable across steam/consoles, mobile, AR/VR, and eventually web
- built atop Godot (essentially using it as a library)
- suitable for games, but also apps
- shippable-quality polish from the beginning of a project, especially in terms of ui

I want to be able to start up a new idea, be up and running as quickly as possible, re-use previous work like crazy, and have my prototype be theoretically shippable from the start. I also want to maintain complete creative freedom, so I'm avoiding diffusion-based AI for now.

You can read more detail about the engine [here](/engine/).

I don't have plans to release the engine itself, at least not for a long while. Instead I'm focused on releasing the projects I build with it. I've been developing a variety of projects as I build out the core features of the engine. You can read about two of them: [AIVX PUSH](/push/), and [AIVX CITY](/city/). 

Push is the first game I'm releasing with the engine, an arcade puzzle game inspired by Lumines and Tetris Effect, with trippy ever-changing procedural visuals and a new mechanic I first prototyped many years ago.

City is an early prototype, my experimentation with a metaverse of sorts. It's an infinite cyberpunk city generator, full of AI-controlled characters you can chat with, play games with, and who can play roles in generated quests.

These are just the first steps in what I expect to be a long, fast journey. Long because it'll be many years, and fast because of how many projects I'll be able to release per year once the core of the engine is ready.

In terms of funding and how I plan to get there, I'm contemplating a few roads. There's a compelling case for a VC-scale venture to be made, but I'm also open to working on a smaller scale with a publisher, or bootstrapping one project at a time on my own. Obviously that last one is the default, and I'm treating it as Plan A. (If you are a source of funding, feel free to email me at funding -at- aivx.io. I'm bad at answering emails, but better at those ones...)
