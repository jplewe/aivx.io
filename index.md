At AIVX, we're building 3D games, apps, and worlds, powered by new core technology.

In the future, we believe:

- Games and apps (even traditional 2D software) will be both AI-native and 3D-native, built on a new kind of core which allows seamless deployment across devices and displays (screens, XR, and beyond). 

- They'll be small and lightweight, eschewing traditional art assets, and will generate themselves entirely at runtime.
 
- They'll be extremely fast and cheap to develop, requiring only an idea and a single coder (human or AI). 

To realize this future, we're developing an LLM-driven procedural generation engine, a new approach to generative AI which is extremely fast and adaptable for real world use today.

Our first product is AIVX PUSH, a mesmerizing puzzle game with ever-changing visuals. A demo is coming soon to Steam, with future releases on mobile and XR. It serves as a proof of concept for the procedural generation layer, generating all visuals and UI on-device at runtime.
