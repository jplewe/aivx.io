I'm an [award-winning software+games dev](/about/), creating a new kind of [generative 3D engine](/engine) so I can build games and apps extremely fast. You can follow my progress here via the [blog](/blog/) or on my socials. Very soon, you'll be able to wishlist my first game in the new engine, [AIVX PUSH](/push/), on Steam. Many other projects are in the works as well; [here are just a few](/projects). This site is brand new and coming in hot, so please let me know if something's broken.
