At AIVX, we're building fully-generative 3D games, apps, and worlds, powered by a new core technology.

In the future, we believe all games and apps (even traditional 2D software) will be:

- both AI-native *and* 3D-native, requiring on a new kind of core which allows seamless deployment across all devices and displays (screens, XR, and beyond) 

- small and lightweight, eschewing traditional art assets, generating themselves entirely on-device at runtime
 
- extremely fast and cheap to develop, requiring only an idea and a single coder (human or AI) 

To realize this future, we're developing an LLM-driven 3D procedural generation engine, a new approach to generative AI which is extremely fast and adaptable for real world use today. It doesn't use diffusion, is geared toward serious development over vibe coding, and retains complete artistic control.

Our first product in the engine is AIVX PUSH, a mesmerizing puzzle game with ever-changing visuals. A demo is coming soon to Steam, with future releases on mobile and XR. It serves as a proof of concept for the procgen layer, generating itself entirely in real-time.
