At AIVX, we're building fully-generative 3D games, apps, and worlds, powered by new core technology.

In the future, we believe:

- Games and apps (even traditional 2D software) will be both AI-native and 3D-native, seamlessly cross-device between screens, XR, and beyond. 

- They'll be small and lightweight, eschewing traditional art assets, and will generate themselves entirely at runtime.
 
- They'll be extremely fast and cheap to develop, requiring only an idea and a single coder (human or AI). 

To realize this future, we're building an AI-native procedural generation engine, an extremely fast and adaptable hybrid approach to 3D.

Our first product is a mesmerizing puzzle game with ever-changing visuals, AIVX PUSH. A demo is coming soon to Steam, with future releases on mobile and XR. It serves as a proof of concept, generating all visuals and UI on-device at runtime.

This site is brand new and coming hot, sorry for the mess.
