I'm an [award-winning software+games dev](/about/), creating a new kind of [generative 3D engine](https://aivx.io/2025/07/26/first-post.html) to build games and apps extremely fast. You can follow my progress here via the [blog](/blog/) or on my [socials](/about). Very soon, you'll be able to wishlist the first game in the new engine, [AIVX PUSH](/push/), on Steam. Many other [projects](/projects) are in the works as well. I'm looking for around [50k in initial funding](/funding).

This site is brand new and coming in hot, sorry for the mess. I wanted to make something I wouldn't spend too much time trying to perfect.
