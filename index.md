title: generative 3d games, apps, and worlds

In the future, all games and apps (even traditional 2D software) will be:

- both AI-native *and* 3D-native, built on a new kind of core which allows seamless deployment across all devices and displays (screens, XR, and beyond) 

- small and lightweight, eschewing traditional art assets, generating themselves entirely at runtime
 
- extremely fast and cheap to develop, requiring only an idea and a single coder (human or AI) 

To realize this future, I'm developing an LLM-driven 3D procedural generation engine, a new approach to generative AI which is extremely fast and adaptable for real world use today.

The first product is AIVX PUSH, a mesmerizing puzzle game with ever-changing visuals. A demo is coming soon to Steam, with future releases on mobile and XR. It serves as a proof of concept for the procedural generation layer, generating all visuals and UI on-device at runtime.
