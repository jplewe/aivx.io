I'm a software/game dev creating a new kind of generative 3D engine so I can build games and apps super fast. You can follow my progress here via the blog or on my socials. Check out the [About](/about/) or read my latest [Post](/blog/). Very soon, you'll be able to wishlist my first game, [AIVX PUSH](/push/), on Steam. I have many other projects in the works as well, stay tuned.
