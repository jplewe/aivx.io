### about me

hi! I'm John Plewe, I'm a longtime developer of popular cross-platform consumer creative software at Nevercenter (Silo, Milo, CameraBag, Pixelmash), and games on the side (Shibuya, Crossgrams). 

my new project, AIVX, is a company built around a novel AI-native approach to procedural generation, for rapidly building new kinds of games, apps, and worlds, and deploying them everywhere (including XR). more soon.

highlights + recognition include a #2 mac app of the year award from Apple, a #1 app on the ios app store, an Epic Games MegaGrant, a PAX 10 Indie Showcase selection, an IGF honorable mention for best mobile game, and being ambushed with job offers from Valve's Gabe Newell in his office full of knives.
