# About Me

I’m a developer working on a new kind of 3D engine that combines procedural generation with AI.  
I love building tools that empower creativity and streamline world-building.

# About the Company

**AIVX** is a solo venture focused on generative technologies for games, simulation, and media.  
We’re building tools that make entire worlds — cities, games, and apps — generate themselves.
