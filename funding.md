I am looking for 50k in initial funding to dive into this full-time. This could come via a publisher/platform holder, angel, VC, etc. (The company is currently an LLC, so I may need to create a new entity to receive some forms of investment.) 

It's early, I'm not currently focused on raising money, and I don't have a deck. Eventually I'll reach out to the usual sources via the usual channels, but I see no reason not to post about it here in case someone wants to jump the queue as I start to show more progress. If you're a provider of funding, you can contact funding@aivx.io.
