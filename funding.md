### funding

I am looking for 50k in initial funding to dive into this project full time. This could come via a publisher/platform holder, angel, VC, etc. (the company is currently an LLC, so I may need to create a new entity to receive investment.) 

I'm not currently focused on raising money and I don't have a deck. Eventually I'll reach out to the usual sources via the usual channels, but I see no reason not to mention it here in case someone wants to jump the queue. If you're a provider of funding, you can contact funding@aivx.io.
