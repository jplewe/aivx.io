I'm happy bootstrapping, but also looking for 50k in initial funding to dive in full-time and significantly accelerate development. This could come via a publisher/platform holder, angel, VC, etc. (The company is currently an LLC, so I may need to create a new entity to receive some forms of investment.) 

It's early, I'm not currently spending time/energy on raising, and I don't have a deck. But if you happen to be a provider of funding and want to jump the queue, you can contact funding@aivx.io.
